Each timepoint corresponds to a specific smell card. There are 6 unique smell cards labeled as A-F. Each participant competes A-F in order and then repeats the cycle A-F so that each card is tested twice for a complete follow up.   \n",

       "811  Example: A dilution series of heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus stock (USA-WA1/2020) was prepared in natural clinical matrix (pooled nasopharyngeal swab samples eluted in VTM). Five (5) replicates were tested per dilution. The testing was performed as per the recommended instructions for use, with the virus in clinical matrix applied directly onto the Swab until the saturation of the flocked tip. The estimated LoD concentration for verification was selected as the concentration in between the dilution factor that returned 5/5 positive test outcomes (100%) and the next dilution factor that returned 0/5 positive (0%) based on the qualitative result.
