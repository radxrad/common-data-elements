This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, ‘lines’ are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time.

In this way,  the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\xa0 As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quiescent state for future use. \n"")",CLO:0000031

The oxygen comes from the atmosphere by solution and from photosynthesis of water plants. The maximum amount of oxygen that can be held in solution in a stream is termed the saturation concentration and, as it is a function of temperature, the greater the temperature, the less the saturation amount. The discharge of an organic waste to a stream imposes an oxygen demand on the stream. If there is an excessive amount of organic matter, the oxidation of waste by microorganisms will consume oxygen more rapidly than it can be replenished. When this happens, the dissolved oxygen is depleted and results in the death of the higher forms of life.',)",http://vocabs.lter-europe.net/EnvThes/USLterCV:161

Automated synthesizers allow the synthesis of oligonucleotides up to about 200 bases.\n\nOligonucleotides are characterized by the sequence of nucleotide residues that comprise the entire molecule. The length of the oligonucleotide is usually denoted by ""mer"" (from Greek meros, ""part""). For example, a fragment of 25 bases would be called a 25-mer. Oligonucleotides readily bind, in a sequence-specific manner, to their respective complementary oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA to form duplexes or, less often, hybrids of a higher order. This basic property serves as a foundation for the use of oligonucleotides as probes for detecting DNA or RNA. Examples of procedures that use oligonucleotides include DNA microarrays, Southern blots, ASO analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and the synthesis of artificial genes.\n\nsource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligonucleotide',)",CHEBI:7754

They are usually spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. This is because some STDs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact.</p> <p>Some STDs can be passed from a pregnant person to the baby, either <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/infectionsandpregnancy.html"">during pregnancy</a> or when giving birth. Other ways that STDs may be spread include during <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/breastfeeding.html"">breastfeeding</a>, through <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bloodtransfusionanddonation.html"">blood transfusions</a>, or by sharing needles.</p> <p>There are more than 20 types of STDs, including:</p><ul> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/chlamydiainfections.html"">Chlamydia</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/genitalherpes.html"">Genital herpes</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/gonorrhea.html"">Gonorrhea</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hiv.html"">HIV</a> </li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/hpv.html"">HPV</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/pubiclice.html"">Pubic lice</a> </li><li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/syphilis.html"">Syphilis</a></li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/trichomoniasis.html"">Trichomoniasis</a></li> </ul> <h3>What causes sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?</h3> <p>STDs can be caused by <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/bacterialinfections.html"">bacteria</a>, <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html"">viruses</a>, and <a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/parasiticdiseases.html"">parasites</a>.</p> <h3>Who is affected by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?</h3> <p>Most STDs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women.If an STD is passed to a baby, it can cause serious health problems.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?</h3> <p>STDs don\'t always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection and not know it. And even without symptoms, STDs can still be harmful and may be passed on during sex.</p> <p>If there are symptoms, they could include:</p><ul> <li>Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina</li> <li>Sores or warts on the genital area</li> <li>Painful or frequent urination (peeing)</li> <li>Itching and redness in the genital area</li> <li>Blisters or sores in or around the mouth</li> <li>Abnormal vaginal odor</li> <li>Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/abdominalpain.html"">Abdominal pain</a>n</li> <li><a href=""https://medlineplus.gov/fever.html"">Fever</a></li> </ul> <h3>How are sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) diagnosed?</h3> <p>If you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STDs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STDs do not usually cause symptoms.</p> <p>Some STDs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STDs.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?</h3> <p>Antibiotics can treat STDs caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STDs caused by viruses, but medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection.</p> <p>Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STDs.

While some suspended material will be large enough and heavy enough to settle rapidly to the bottom of the container if a liquid sample is left to stand (the settable solids), very small particles will settle only very slowly or not at all if the sample is regularly agitated or the particles are colloidal. These small solid particles cause the liquid to appear turbid. Turbidity (or haze) is also applied to transparent solids such as glass or plastic.
